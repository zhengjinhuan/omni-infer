The VM OS materialized shared access of mainframe systems to the next level by allowing multiple distinct computing environments to live in the same physical environment. Most of the basic functions of current virtualization software are inherited from this early VM OS. virtualization software is now represented with the term hypervisor. Hardware virtualization is used to share the resources of the cloud providers effectively with the customers by generating an illusion of dedicated computing, storage, and networking on a computing infrastructure\""
